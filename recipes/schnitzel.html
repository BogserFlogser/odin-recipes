    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Schnitzel with potatoes is a classic Czech dish that features a thin, breaded and fried cutlet of pork or veal served with crispy potatoes. The meat is typically pounded thin and then coated in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs before being fried until golden brown. The potatoes are usually sliced thin and pan-fried until crispy, often with onions or other vegetables. The dish is typically served with a side of pickles or a simple salad for a satisfying and hearty meal.</p>
