# odin-recipes
First Odin Project

Before

I will code a recipe page with the limited knowledge i have of HTML and will try to make it look organized and easy to read. I will use lists and images and do my best.

After

I used pretty much all i know from HTML and tried to make the pages look as organized and easy to read as possible. I like using lists as they look
good on even simple sites. Overall a fun first project
